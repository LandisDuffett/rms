rms (Reimbursement Management System) is a web app to be used internally at a company or institution for the purpose
of allowing employees to submit requests for reimbursement, view previous and pending requests and mange their account
information as well as allowing a manager to view all employee requests and approve or deny those requests.

The app is created using Java with a Spring Boot framework on the back end connecting to an AWS RDS using Postgresql. 
It uses Angular and Bootstrap to create the font end. The front end application for this app can be found at:
https://github.com/LandisDuffett/rms-frontend

The app uses Heroku for automating the build, CI and deployment (rms-front-end.herokuapp.com).
